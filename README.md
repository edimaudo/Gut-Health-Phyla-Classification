# Gut Microbe Disease Classification

## Objective 
Develop a multi-label classification model to classify different diseases based on the microorganisms in the gut microbiome.  The solution is in an .ipynb file.

### How to run the file
Running a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) can be achieved through several methods, primarily using Jupyter Notebook itself, cloud-based services like Google Colab, or integrated development environments (IDEs) like VS Code.
1. Using Jupyter Notebook (Local Installation):
Install Jupyter Notebook: If you don't have it, install Anaconda (which includes Jupyter) or install Jupyter Notebook directly via pip:
Code

```
    pip install notebook
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook: Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and type:
Code
```
    jupyter notebook
```
This will open a new tab in your web browser, displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
Navigate and Open: In the dashboard, navigate to the directory where your .ipynb file is located and click on the file name to open it.
Run Cells: Once the notebook is open, you can run individual cells by clicking the "Run" button or using keyboard shortcuts like Shift + Enter (run and move to next cell) or Ctrl + Enter (run and stay on current cell).
Stop the Server: Close the browser tab and then stop the server running in your terminal/command prompt (usually by pressing Ctrl + C).
